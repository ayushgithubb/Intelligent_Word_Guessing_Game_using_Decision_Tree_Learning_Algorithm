# Intelligent_Word_Guessing_Game_using_Decision_Tree_Learning_Algorithm
The objective of this project is to design and implement a decision tree learning algorithm that can play the word-guessing game between Melbo and Melbot. The algorithm's aim is to guess the secret word chosen by Melbot within a limited number of queries, utilizing a decision tree structure to guide its guesses.
